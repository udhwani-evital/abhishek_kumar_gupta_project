# PatientApi

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 14.2.13.It creates a new patient and fetches the newly created patient detail.

## Features

- **Responsive**:Responsiveness to adjust for variable screen sizes.
- **Collapsible Navbar**: The app features a collapsible navigation bar with links to "Add Patient" and "View Patient" for easy access.
- **Routing**: Implements Angular's router for navigation between pages and components, ensuring smooth transitions.
- **CanDeactivate Guard**: Protects users from accidental navigation by warning them before leaving a form with unsaved changes.
- **Reactive Forms**: Utilizes Angular’s Reactive Forms for robust form management, including dynamic form building and handling.
- **Form Validation**: Implements strict form validation with Angular Material form controls to ensure the integrity of user input.
- **Error Handling**: Centralized error handling for HTTP requests, providing clear feedback to the user when something goes wrong.
- **Loading Spinner**: Displays a loading spinner to enhance the user experience by indicating when data is being fetched or submitted.
- **Fallback Message**: Shows a fallback message when there is no data or when a request fails, ensuring a clear UX even in edge cases.
- **Angular Material Styling**: The entire app is styled using Angular Material components, providing a modern and responsive design.
- **Form from Angular Material**: Utilizes Angular Material components for building the form UI, ensuring a consistent and sleek design.
- **HTTP Client Services**: Uses Angular’s `HttpClient` service to manage API requests, abstracted within services for code reuse and maintainability.
- **Pipes and Map Operator**: Angular pipes are used for formatting data in the template, while RxJS `map` operator is employed in services for data transformations.
- **Subject in Services**: Leverages `Subject` from RxJS to manage and share state between components in a reactive way.
- **Navigation After Form Submission**: After successfully submitting a form, the app automatically navigates the user to a different route (e.g., the "View Patient" page).
- **Strict Form Validation**: Ensures all forms have robust validation, including required fields, pattern matching, and custom validators to enforce data integrity.
